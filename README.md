# STAT 545A participation

Welcome to my participation repo for __STAT 545A__, offered at [The University of British Columbia](www.ubc.ca).  This repo holds all of my class work, both in-class exercises where we learn to do certain things, as well as projects and homework, etc, that I work on.  The [course website can be found here](https://stat545.stat.ubc.ca).

## Repo Orientation

The class consists of 14 classes/lectures.  In most classes, we produce something in the form of participation in an activity.  This repo has a folder for each of the 14 classes, with all relevant files for that particular class in it.  For most of the classes, the end product of our participation is a RMD file that is complioed into either a pdf of an HTML document.

Below are links to each class/lecture's folder.  Links are provided both to the folder holding all of the files for that class, as well as a link to the main product from each class (most often a .pdf, .md, or an HTML file).

## Who am I?

My name is _**Mike Marin**_ and I am a Senior Instructor at The University of British Columbia, in [The School of Population and Public Health](www.spph.ubc.ca).  I love statistics, I love teaching, and I love randomness and games of chance.  

>My love for statistics came out of my love for solving puzzles, playing games of chance (casino games, board games, etc).  

I am taking STAT 545 to update my knowledge on R, mainly use of the __tidyverse__ .  When I was trained, RStudio didn't even exist!  I want to be able to pass on to my own students more modern ways of working in R, as I mainly code using base-R, although I don't want to be a dinosaur who says stuck in his old ways!

I also have a [YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/marinstatlectures) introducing the use of R, which I have used for my statistics courses. They start at the very beginning, and assume very little knowledge of coding.  The channel also contains more advanced videos, as well as videos introducing statistics concepts at an introductory/indermediate level.

One piece of adivce I will give for work/career (and this is partly to make use of a numbered list):

- Find something you like/love to do
- Find out what you are good at
- Find out what you can get paid for

If you can find something that covers all 3 of these simultaneously, you will have a great work-life!
